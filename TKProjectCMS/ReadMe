This is the documentation file for developers of  team Papa.

We are developing the CMS by using React (for the UI/ client app) and Node for handling the server part.
The communication between the two will be done using WebSockets. It'll be more like a distributed system
formed by apps that communicate by passing messages.


For getting a better understanding of our project architecture following tutorials may help you.
(Add better tutorials to the list if you find any)

VERSIONING SYSTEM
=================

We are using GIT as our VCS.We will have a master branch and a development branch. Master branch must always have a
deliverable project in working condition. The development branch can have the in-progress codes.

You could go through the following tutorials for getting a flavour of the VCS system that we are going to follow
through out the development, testing and deployment of the CMS.
